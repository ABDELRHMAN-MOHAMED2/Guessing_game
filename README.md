# 🎯 Guessing Number Game  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a simple **Guessing Number Game** built using **C++**. The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess it. After each incorrect guess, the program provides hints whether the guess was **too high** or **too low**. The game keeps track of the number of attempts until the correct number is guessed.

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.  
2. The user is asked to enter an integer.  
3. If the input is **not a valid integer**, the program will prompt the user again.  
4. If the guess is **too high**, the program asks the user to try again.  
5. If the guess is **too low**, the program asks the user to try again.  
6. Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays a **success message** and the **number of attempts**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **C++**  
- `iostream` (for input/output operations)  
- `cstdlib` (for random number generation)  
- `ctime` (for seeding the random generator)
